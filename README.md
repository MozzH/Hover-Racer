# Hover-Racer

A hover-racer game I've written in my second year of University on the game engine "TL-Engine" with C++, Game was featured on the UCLan GameDev Day for creativity.


The C++ code contains hard-coded mathematical & physical functions to detect collision, simulate realistic velocity and friction and send the car back if it hits a surface.



The game was featured on the UCLan GameDev Day which featured a lot of amazing creations by students, my game was featured for creativity.



In order to run the code and see the game for yourself, you'll need to download the "TL-Engine" Which was provided by the University.
